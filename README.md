\# My Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for diagnosing COVID-19 using audio signals of coughs. It utilizes feature extraction and classification techniques to classify coughs as COVID-19 positive or negative.

\## Features

- Preprocessing of audio signals
- Feature extraction from cough segments
- Model training and evaluation
- Model comparison

\## Dataset

The VIRUFY Respiratory database was used for training and testing the model. It contains audio recordings of coughs along with corresponding RT-PCR test results.

\## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
1. Install the required dependencies.
1. Run the main script for training and testing the model.
1. Make predictions using the trained model on new data.
